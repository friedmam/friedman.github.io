                various states (excluding Washington, as his home state), according to his phone's 
                location data. This project involved data reading, sorting, and analyzing latitutde 
                and longitude, and using the Haversine formula and geomapping to convert the data points
                into useable data that could be associated with different states. This project was 
                completed as part of a Data Science course.

                    Our final group project for the Spring 2024 semester in Game Development was 
                    this 3D first person shooter game we called Temple Traders. We went through many 
                    design iterations for this project, as we had many ideas but wanted to ensure we 
                    had a cohesive game design that could also be reasonably completed within a month. 
                    We initially wanted to focus on some kind of arena game, and had ideas like 
                    environmental-based ways to defeat enemies, as well as a system similar to Little 
                    Alchemy that would allow you to combine aspects of the arena to create special 
                    abilities. However, our professor advised us against trying to create crafting 
                    systems, as those typically end up taking longer than we would have time for. 
                    Instead, we focused on creating an upgrade system to buy different guns, speed 
                    upgrades, and health. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My major contribution was creating the enemies. Initially I had ideas for 8 
                    different classes of enemies, but was having difficulties finding different 
                    animated meshes for the project (we did not know any art students familiar enough 
                    with Blender or a similar 3D software that could create models for us). In the 
                    end, only 3 free meshes were available and distinct enough for the project. The 
                    projectiles generated were not attached to the animations of the creatures, so I 
                    had to ensure the projectiles being thrown looked as if they were coming from the 
                    hand of the creature.

                This group project was completed under the supervision of Michael Tran, who was 
                our professor at DIS in Copenhagen, Denmark while we studied abroad in the 
                Spring of 2024. The purpose of this project was to explore 2D game design and all 
                its elements, including “juice” (extra effects that immerse the reader), 
                animation, movements and player controllers, and collisions and physics 
                interactions. My primary contribution to this project was with the animation and 
                handling animation triggers and events for all animated sprites. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our initial plan for this game was to create a 2d platform game with some 
                element of corruption, which we decided would best be represented by the 
                transformation of the dinosaurs from gross-looking blobs to their happy colorful 
                selves. Initially, we wanted the game to be focused on finding more complicated 
                things to help “unlock” the dinosaurs and allow them to be free from their 
                corrupted prison, but decided that didn’t give the player much motivation for 
                freeing the dinosaurs. Instead, we decided to have the unlocked dinosaurs assist 
                the player by standing on buttons and acting as platforms that can be jumped on. 
                Had we had more time with this game, we would have added more complicated levels, 
                as well as obstacles (such as spikes), and changed the visuals of the environment 
                across each level. We also would have provided a more expansive cutscene at the 
                beginning to explain how the dinos became corrupted and why you’re being tasked 
                with finding them.

                    This project is a music composition creator that was created over a semester in a 
                    Software Design class. Each week, we would have new requirements for the 
                    composition panel that required us to rethink our initial structure’s design. The 
                    purpose of the class was to teach us about code structure, design, and ways to 
                    minimize technical debt. The final product was created as a team featuring myself, 
                    Andrew Kuhlken, Henry Young, and Diego Quispe Vilcahuaman.

                    The project’s goal was to create an accessible way to create music for people 
                    without any formal music training.

                This was one of my first big programming projects. I and two other students learned 
                Swift in our high school’s Advanced Topics Computer Science class. Our school’s 
                schedule was intentionally designed to be random, which meant that every day would 
                have different classes in a different order. Our goal was to use the .csv file 
                that the school created annually of the student schedule to produce a working 
                customizable calendar based on individual classes and preferences. My group 
                consisted of myself, Michelle Xu, and Linnea Leaver. The following list showcases
                some of the main features of the project.
