# About Me
Hi, I’m Lee James Friedman! I also go by LJ. I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with minors in Math and Psychology at Whitman College. Originally from the Bay Area in California, I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and creative expression.

As part of my academic pursuits, I’ve written several papers on various projects, which are available in the "Design Posts" tab in the header. You can also find a few of my completed programming projects under the "Projects" tab, a small selection of my own photography and music compositions in the "Photography" and "Music" tabs, and a few ideas for future projects below.
