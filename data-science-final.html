        <h2>Deriving National Happiness</h2>
        <p>By LJ Friedman and Rena Takahashi</p>
        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>
            We used multiple data sets for our analysis. Our main focus was on the 
            <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/happiest-countries-in-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

            </a> 
            data (World Population Review), and we wanted to see how the following other data 
            sets interacted with the happiest country rankings:

            </a>
            (World Bank Group). Using these data, we explored the question: What is the relationship between a 
            country’s economic and natural resources, and the country’s overall happiness level? 
        </p>
        <p>
            To answer this question, we looked at four resources of each country: cost of living, healthcare 
            expenditure per capita, annual precipitation, and percentage of land occupied for agriculture. 
            Agriculture and precipitation were used for a few reasons. While they are not directly tied to 
            economics, they are indicators of whether or not the country’s land is used to stimulate the economy. 
            Although everyone needs to eat, not everywhere can grow food. Access to agricultural land and water 
            sources (such as rain) thus become crucial for supporting a population. But does the ability to generate 
            a surplus of food impact how happy a country is? Or is the field of agriculture working against happiness?
        </p>
        <p>
            Our approach to the data was to first examine the data on choropleth maps, to see if there were any 
            interesting or notable geographical similarities or differences to explore. Then, we examined the 
            relationships between happiness and our other variables using scatter and box plots, to determine if there 
            was any relationship between them. We used four quartiles of happiness for the box plots, in a style 
            reminiscent of 
            <a href="https://earthbound.report/2018/11/14/the-four-levels-of-global-income/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

        <p><strong>Data Preparation</strong></p>
        <p>
            We initially planned to work with the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, but we were unable to find 
            a simple way to convert the data into a comma-separated value (CSV) format. Because of this, we decided to 
            pivot into using smaller more specialized datasets, and simply pull from multiple sources and sets to use 
            for our data analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            When preparing the data, we first had to import the .csv files and load them in as dataframes. From there, 
            we selected the columns that we were interested in, and combined them all from every data set into one 
            dataframe that contained all of the information we were interested in. Then, we pulled from a 
            <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johan/world.geo.json/master/countries.geo.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                .json file on Github
            </a>
            to ensure we could create proper maps of the countries to visualize our data. Notably, some of the country 
            names were inconsistent across data sets, and this was impacting our ability to merge the data together. 
            To solve this, I created a list of mismatched country names, and converted the data set to use the .json’s 
            country names, to ensure that we could visualize them.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were also some issues where the datasets themselves had small issues, inclusions, or exclusions 
            that were superfluous. Some data sets contained sovereign city-states (Monaco), which we opted to exclude
            as they were not in the .json mapping data. There were also several countries that did not have recent data, 
            but had older data, and in these cases we opted to use the most recent data possible (for instance, Syria 
            was missing health expenditure data past 2012). This may have a small impact on our data analysis, although 
            these are not a large number of countries.

        <p>
            When observing our choropleth maps, we noticed several general trends related to happiness as well as 
            several mismatches. Figures 1 and 2 show clearly that at least a small part of the calculations for 
            happiest countries either implicitly or explicitly also measure the cost of living in said country, with 
            a positive relationship — that is, the higher the cost of living, the higher the happiness. However, 
            this is not a perfect relationship, as Finland — the happiest-scoring country — does not have the highest 
            cost of living. So this may indicate that there is a ceiling to how beneficial an increased cost of living 
            is to happiness, after which citizens become less happy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Figure 3’s health expenditure visualization also raises some questions. Generally, North America, Western 
            Europe, Australia, and New Zealand spend significantly more on healthcare costs per capita than other 
            countries. While those same countries score higher in happiness, comparing Africa to wide parts of South 
            America and Asia shows that health expenditure is not the whole story, as the majority of these continents 
            spend similar amounts of money on healthcare, and yet score very differently in happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Figures 4 and 5 are a bit more confusing to read when compared to Figure 1. Although the rainier countries 
            in Africa are associated with a lower happiness score, the opposite is true in Europe, and there seems to 
            be little association at all in South America and Africa. Likewise, Figure 5 seems to simply show that 
            agricultural land thrives best closer to the equator, with long growing seasons, more than correlating 
            directly with happiness scores.

            The scatter plots and boxplots give us a better idea of the relationship between our variables and 
            happiness scores. From Figures 6-9, we can clearly see a very strong relationship between happiness 
            scores and both cost of living and healthcare expenditure.

            It is unclear whether or not there is an association between precipitation and happiness based on 
            Figures 10 and 11. The majority of countries have lower average precipitation, with the exception of 
            only a few countries, as seen in Figure 10 with the majority of countries on the left side of the 
            scatterplot. This shows that there is a general skew that is also present in the boxplot of Figure 
            11, meaning it would be difficult to extract meaningful data. From the boxplot, it looks like there 
            is a slight upward trend, where the countries in the bottom quartile of happiness tend to get less 
            rain, and the amount of rain a country receives increases through the upper middle quartile. However, 
            countries in the top quartile of happiness jump down in precipitation again. There could be many 
            possible reasons for this; we know the happiness data is linked in part to GDP, and we have studied 
            that impacts of climate change have disproportionately impacted poorer countries (with lower GDP) 
            (PBS). Possibly this extends to rainfall, or perhaps countries more impacted by climate change are 
            less happy.

            Connections between happiness and agricultural land percentage are equally unclear; it looks as if 
            there is significance, but with a small effect size (that is, the percentage of land dedicated to 
            agriculture does have an impact on the happiness of a country, but that impact remains small compared 
            to other factors). Figure 12 shows that all countries are relatively evenly dispersed among agricultural 
            percentages, but Figure 13’s boxplot shows us a very slight trend downwards across quartiles, indicating 
            a negative relationship between agricultural land and happiness. This may be due to a number of factors. 
            For instance, farming is not as lucrative of a business as other endeavors, so having more farmland may 
            drive GDP and therefore the country’s spending power down, making it harder to access global goods and 
            the global economy. This was also measured in space, which could mean that when countries dedicate more 
            space to farming, they are not able to have enough space for other things that may boost happiness scores.

        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p>
            In our introduction, we asked about the connection between a country’s economy and natural resources and 
            their happiness score. Our findings showed a mix of results, with several areas for further study. 
        </p>

            Our data show a noticeable positive association between happiness scores and both cost of living and 
            healthcare expenditure per capita. This may reflect the relationship between higher standards of living 
            and costs, where, for example, places with higher taxes are able to put more money into social services, 
            ultimately benefiting everyone while also increasing cost of living. However, since Finland, with the 
            highest happiness score, does not also have an extraordinarily high cost of living or healthcare expenditure, 
            there may be a “sweet spot” of spending associated with maximum happiness levels.

            Findings related to natural resources of agricultural land and water are more inconclusive. Although there 
            are some small patterns, like the small negative correlation between percentage of agricultural land and 
            happiness level, it is a very small correlation that is much less obvious than the economic factors. This 
            indicates that economic and sociopolitical factors seem much more likely to influence a country’s 
            positivity score than their natural resources.

            We acknowledge that the calculations used to determine a country’s overall “happiness” is highly 
            arbitrary and very likely subject to certain cultural values of the data collectors. For example, one of 
            the performance categories monitored is “generosity of the general population,” and since generosity may 
            look very different in different countries and may not always be valued as a positive trait, this may be 
            an inaccurate source of data. Similarly, “freedom to make life choices” may not be as valuable to some 
            people or cultures than others. When we acknowledge happiness as cultural, it is easy to see that the 
            creators of the happiness scores are very likely to prioritize their own culture’s standards of happiness 
            over a balanced and perhaps unknown perspective. Thus, it is easily possible that the happiness score is 
            actually measuring the data collector’s happiness levels with the country, rather than the country’s 
            intrinsic satisfaction with itself.

            We were limited somewhat in this exploration due to our limited data sets, so we were only able to 
            explore a few variables. In future data explorations, comparing information on other sociopolitical 
            factors such as social trust, income inequality, air quality, and population education levels may be 
            beneficial to expand the conclusions that can be drawn. Additionally, drawing from these data over time 
            and comparing them to countries’ happiness levels over time may also reveal information about how various 
            factors fluctuate in their influence on happiness levels.
