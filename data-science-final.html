        <h2>Deriving National Happiness</h2>
        <p>By LJ Friedman and Rena Takahashi</p>
        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>
            We used multiple data sets for our analysis. Our main focus was on the 
            <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/happiest-countries-in-the-world">
                List of Happiest Countries Rankings in 2024
            </a> 
            data (World Population Review), and we wanted to see how the following other data 
            sets interacted with the happiest country rankings: 
            <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/cost-of-living-by-country">
                Cost of Living Rankings by Country in 2024
            </a> 
            (World Population Review); 
            <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD?locations=1W">
                Health Expenditure per Capita by Country in 2021
            </a>, 
            <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.PRCP.MM?most_recent_value_desc=true">
                Average Annual Precipitation by Country in 2021
            </a>, and the 
            <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.AGRI.ZS?most_recent_value_desc=true&view=map">
                Percentage of Land Dedicated for Agriculture in 2021 
            </a>
            (World Bank Group). Using these data, we explored the question: What is the relationship between a 
            country’s economic and natural resources, and the country’s overall happiness level? 
        </p>
        <p>
            To answer this question, we looked at four resources of each country: cost of living, healthcare 
            expenditure per capita, annual precipitation, and percentage of land occupied for agriculture. 
            Agriculture and precipitation were used for a few reasons. While they are not directly tied to 
            economics, they are indicators of whether or not the country’s land is used to stimulate the economy. 
            Although everyone needs to eat, not everywhere can grow food. Access to agricultural land and water 
            sources (such as rain) thus become crucial for supporting a population. But does the ability to generate 
            a surplus of food impact how happy a country is? Or is the field of agriculture working against happiness?
        </p>
        <p>
            Our approach to the data was to first examine the data on choropleth maps, to see if there were any 
            interesting or notable geographical similarities or differences to explore. Then, we examined the 
            relationships between happiness and our other variables using scatter and box plots, to determine if there 
            was any relationship between them. We used four quartiles of happiness for the box plots, in a style 
            reminiscent of 
            <a href="https://earthbound.report/2018/11/14/the-four-levels-of-global-income/">
                Hans Rosling’s four levels of wealth.

        <p><strong>Data Preparation</strong></p>
        <p>
            We initially planned to work with the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, but we were unable to find 
            a simple way to convert the data into a comma-separated value (CSV) format. Because of this, we decided to 
            pivot into using smaller more specialized datasets, and simply pull from multiple sources and sets to use 
            for our data analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            When preparing the data, we first had to import the .csv files and load them in as dataframes. From there, 
            we selected the columns that we were interested in, and combined them all from every data set into one 
            dataframe that contained all of the information we were interested in. Then, we pulled from a 
            <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johan/world.geo.json/master/countries.geo.json">
                .json file on Github
            </a>
            to ensure we could create proper maps of the countries to visualize our data. Notably, some of the country 
            names were inconsistent across data sets, and this was impacting our ability to merge the data together. 
            To solve this, I created a list of mismatched country names, and converted the data set to use the .json’s 
            country names, to ensure that we could visualize them.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were also some issues where the datasets themselves had small issues, inclusions, or exclusions 
            that were superfluous. Some data sets contained sovereign city-states (Monaco), which we opted to exclude
            as they were not in the .json mapping data. There were also several countries that did not have recent data, 
            but had older data, and in these cases we opted to use the most recent data possible (for instance, Syria 
            was missing health expenditure data past 2012). This may have a small impact on our data analysis, although 
            these are not a large number of countries.
