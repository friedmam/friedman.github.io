                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m Lee James Friedman! I also go by LJ. I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science 
                    with minors in Math, Music, and Psychology at Whitman College. Originally from the Bay Area in 
                    California, I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of technology, social justice, and 
                    creative expression.
                </p>
                <p>As part of my academic pursuits, I’ve written several papers on various projects, which are 
                    available in the "Design Posts" tab in the header. You can also find a few of my completed 
                    programming projects under the "Projects" tab, a small selection of my own photography and music 
                    compositions in the "Photography" and "Music" tabs, and a few ideas for future projects below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enjoy exploring!
